## Is it useful to know my password?
 Maybe, If you forgot it and you don't wanna use the reset password option.
 But in fact, It's a fun tweak to realize RadioJavan knows your password.

## How can I use this tweak?
You can compile and install it on your device or download and install it directly from my repo:
